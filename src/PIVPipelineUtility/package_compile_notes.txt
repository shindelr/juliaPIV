The command below will only work from inside of the PIVPipelineUtility directory.
The compiled package will end up in a dir called "piv_build", one step up from
PIVPipelineUtility. Use the force=true arg to replace an existing piv_build directory.
The precompile_execution_file argument is pretty important to speed up the time 
needed to spin up new Julia processes.
