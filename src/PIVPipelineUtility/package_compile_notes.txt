The command below will only work from inside of the PIVPipelineUtility directory.
The compiled package will end up in a dir called "piv_build", one step up from
PIVPipelineUtility. Use the force=true arg to replace an existing piv_build directory.
The precompile_execution_file argument is pretty important to speed up the time 
needed to spin up new Julia processes.

This is going to need to be automated so that the program can be compiled on the
system it's intended to be used on. Will need to change how the precompile.jl script
works too so that paths are relative.
